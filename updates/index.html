                      <p>New year, new me! I can't believe I started this site as a freshman, and in a few months I'm going to be a senior. This page has come so far, and I still love it so much as when I first made it!
                        I started driving... which is scary but it's really fun as well. I'm amazed how much can change in just a few years.

                      <p>Okok this took so long to do, but I like it now much more than I did before c: I changed the styling of the pages once again, moved things around, and finally started using style sheets for my needs.</p>

                      <p>Hello!! This is the first update that im going to do, and I plan on doing recaps of my month and also having this act as a changelog for the website!</p>
                      <h3>Updates</h3>
                      <p>March 2023 didnt have that many things happening, I think the main thing that was really fun for me was being in a choir concert. This was my first time singing alto, and it was... interesting to say the least. I also learned a <i>lot</i> of css and html, and here I am now on neocities. </p>
